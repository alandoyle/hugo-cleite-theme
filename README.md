## Configuration

> You can find an example of the final configuration [here](https://github.com/alandoyle/hugo-cleite-theme/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml).

### Basic

```toml
baseurl = "/"           # The base URL of your Hugo site
title = "titlehere"     # The title of your Hugo site
googleAnalytics = ""    # Your Google Analytics tracking ID
enableRobotsTXT = true
language = "en"
paginate = 5            # The numbers of posts per page
theme = "cleite"        # Your Hugo theme
```

There's a lot more information about the basic configuration of an Hugo site [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/).

### Description, favicon and logo params

```toml
[params]
    author = ""       # The default author name, if an author is not specified in the front matter of an individual post.
    description = ""  # Description for the meta description tag
    favicon = ""      # Relative URL for your favicon
    logo = ""         # Absolute URL for your logo
    custom_css = [""] # Array of custom CSS files
```

### Hero

```toml
[params.hero]
    textColor = "" # Empty for default color
```

### Call To Action

```toml
[params.cta] # Call To Action
    show = true
    cta = "Contact"  # Text message of the CTA
    link = "contact" # Relative URL
```

### Separators between Home sections

```toml
[params.separator]
    show = true
```

### Contact information

```toml
[params.contact]
    email = ""
    phone = ""
    skype = ""
    address = ""
```

### Social Networks

```toml
[params.social]
    twitter = ""

    netlify = false # Only if you are using Netlify
    action = ""
    method = ""
    inputNameName = ""
    inputNameLabel = ""
    inputNamePlaceholder = ""
    inputEmailName = ""
    inputEmailLabel = ""
    inputEmailPlaceholder = ""
    inputMsgName = ""
    inputMsgLabel = ""
    inputMsgLength = 750

### Privacy

```toml

        anonymizeIP = true
        disable = false
        respectDoNotTrack = true
        useSessionStorage = false
    [privacy.instagram]
        disable = false
        simple = false
    [privacy.twitter]
        disable = false
        enableDNT = true
        simple = false
    [privacy.vimeo]
        disable = false
        simple = false
    [privacy.youtube]
        disable = false
        privacyEnhanced = true
```

To learn more about privacy configuration check the [official documentation](https://gohugo.io/about/hugo-and-gdpr/).

### Custom CSS

To add custom CSS you have to create a folder called `static` in the root of your project. Then, create another folder called `css` inside `assets`. And finally, a file called `custom.css` inside `css` with your styles.

```bash
$ mkdir -p ./static/css/
```

## Archetypes

Cleite includes three base archetypes:

- _default_: for content such as blogs posts.
- _section_: for the sections on your Home page.
- _page_: for pages like the About page.

So be careful. Creating a new site with Hugo also creates a default archetype that replaces the one provided by Cleite.

### Home and Single pages

To create your home page run the following command inside your Hugo site:

```bash
$ hugo new _index.md -k page
```

Or to create another page:

```bash
$ hugo new example.md -k page
```

You'll get something like this:

```markdown
---
title: ""
description: ""
images: []
draft: true
menu: main
weight: 0
cover:
    image: "/images/cover_image.jpg"
    alt: "Image Description"
    relative: false
---
```

Some properties are used as follows:

- _title_: is the name that will be displayed in the menu. In the rest of the single pages the main title of the content.
- _description_: in the case of the home page the description is not shown. In the rest of the single pages it is shown as a subtitle.
- _images_: in the case of the home page the first image is used as the background image for the hero and to share on social networks (with [Twitter Cards](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/abouts-cards.html) and [Facebook Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/)). In every other page or post is used only for share on social networks.
- _weight_: sets the order of the items in the menu.
The _cover_ section defines a Cover Image for the page.

## Home page Sections

To create a new section in your Home page follow the next steps:

```bash
$ hugo new sections/example.md -k section
```

You'll come across something like this:

```markdown
---
title: "Example"
description: ""
draft: true
weight: 0
---
```

The _title_ is used as the title of your new section and the content is the body. At this moment the _description_ is not used for anything.

The _weight_ defines the order in case of having more than one section.

### Blog or List pages

To create a Blog or a page with a similar structure follow these steps:

```bash
$ hugo new posts/_index.md -k page
```

> In this case it is only necessary to set, if wanted, the _title_ and the _weight_ in the _\_index.md_.

To add a new posts run the following command:

```bash
$ hugo new posts/bad-example.md
```

Inside this file you'll find something like this:

```markdown
---
title: "Bad example"
description: ""
author: ""
date: 2018-12-27T21:09:45+01:00
publishDate: 2018-12-27T21:09:45+01:00
images: []
draft: true
tags: []
showToc: true
cover:
    image: "/images/cover_image.jpg"
    alt: "Image Description"
    relative: false
---
```

The _title_ and _description_ are used as the main title and subtitle respectively.

> You can find more information about the basic parameters in the [official documentation](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/).

The _showToc_ is used to generate a Table of Contents from all h1 and h2 tags

The _cover_ section defines a Cover Image for the post.

Then, the corresponding section will show a list of cards with the _title_, the _date_, a _summary of the content_ (truncated to 480 words) and a list of _tags_ if any.

### Contact

For the contact page follow these instructions:

```bash
$ hugo new contact/_index.md -k page
```

The _title_ and _description_ will be used as the main title and subtitle respectively with a contact form. The rest of the options are defined in the [config.toml](https://github.com/alandoyle/hugo-cleite-theme/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml).

## Multilingual Support

If your site is multilingual, add each language to your config.toml parameters with the following structure:

```bash
[languages]
    [languages.en]
        languageName = "en"
        weight = 1
        contentDir = "content/en"
      [languages.de]
        languageName = "de"
        weight = 2
        contentDir = "content/de"
      [languages.fr]
        languageName = "fr"
        weight = 3
        contentDir = "content/fr"
```

The theme assumes you have one default language, defined in config.toml as defaultContentLanguage. These pages will be at root of the URL, while the other languages will be in their own subdirectory.

You can overwrite all Site parameters in config.url by adding them to the respective language, for example:

```bash
[languages.de]
  languageName = "de"
  weight = 2
  contentDir = "content/de"
  title = "Das ist der deutsche Titel"
  description = "Das ist die deutsche Beschreibung"
```

For translating the contact form, add these parameters:

```bash
[languages.de.params]
  [languages.de.params.form] # Translate contact form fields
    inputNameLabel = "Name"
    inputNamePlaceholder = "Dein Name"
    inputEmailLabel = "E-mail"
    inputEmailPlaceholder = "Deine E-Mail-Adresse"
    inputMsgLabel = "Schreib etwas"
    inputSubmitValue = "Abschicken"
    [languages.de.params.cta] # Translate Call To Action
        show = true
        cta = "Kontakt"
        link = "de/kontakt/" # Relative URL
```

Activate the language switcher in the header by setting:

```bash
[params.languageSwitcher]
    show = true
```
